OpenRocket-ActEC
==========

Overview
--------

OpenRocket-ActEC (Active Energy Control) is a testbed for high-power rocket flight computers that control active energy elements during the boost/coast phase of a rocket.

ActEC is intended foremost to perform sensitivity analyses on control algorithms. ActEC makes use of the pre-existing OpenRocket project and Bill Kuker's Dispersion project to provide an accurate model of a rocket's flight.

ActEC is being developed in response to RPI's participation in the 2016 NASA Student Launch competition. RPI's competition objective is to guide a rocket as close to 5280 feet as possible using variable drag elements; ActEC will fulfill the need for validation of our control systems.

ActEC is currently in development. The estimated date of completion is January 2016.

Current features/wishlist:

* Integrated 3D graphing of trajectories (Complete)
* Batch simulations (Complete)
* Flight computer interface (Partially Complete)
* Control system interface
* Virtual sensors
* Drag element flight models (Complete)
* Sensor fuzzing
* Launch condition fuzzing
