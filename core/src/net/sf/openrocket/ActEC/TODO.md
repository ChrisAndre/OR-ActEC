In no particular order (and not limited to =D):

* Add name, size fields to control set
* Expose name field to Python so that a specific control set can be addressed
* Throw all the available sensors into a sensor group and just pass that to the controller script
* Add a scriptable drag element that maps a control u to a normalized drag force (or just projected area...)

Minor stuff:

* Don't forget to add a save class for the control elements. Cannot save a rocket at the moment.
* Add visual for control elements
